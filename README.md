Manga Link's Server in Python

MangaLink is a free mobile app that manga fans can use to read and download manga in different languages. This app uses a platform called the
Mangadex API to display high-quality manga images. The app has a wide variety of manga genres, such as action, adventure, romance, comedy, and
more, which suit the readerâ€™s preferences. The app also recommends manga titles to users based on their reading history and preferences. It uses
collaborative filtering which is a powerful recommendation system that makes suggestions based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.
